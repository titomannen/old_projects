I made this just because I was tired of the awful ones that are free to use on the web. Basically I love to play football manager and I used to draw every player that I had on the team and the players that I would keep but with this method I lost track to players and was difficult to update a squad manually by drawing in a sketchbook, so I had the brilliant idea of googling different tools that I thought would help to overcome this issue. What I found was that there were no free tool online that had what I wanted in mind, so I just thought to create one that was easy to use and that I could easily track. This one was a little more difficult to create and I followed some tutorials for some things, but I ended up asking tons of questions to ChatGPT. Not really proud of this one, I tend to come back and refine it for better usage.
